# OOP Game Show App

<p>A word guessing game that uses object oriented Javascript concepts to be created.</p>

<h2>How does the game work?</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to correctly guess the random phrase within 5 attempts.</p>
<p>The player may select a letter they wish to guess by clicking on one of the letters on the on screen keyboard or they may press on that letter key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>If you win or lose you will get a win or lose message and an option to start the game over.</p>
</p>Restarting the game resets the selected keys and possibly chooses a new phrase (Sometimes the same phrase will appear but not always).</p>

<h2>Added CSS Styles</h2>
<p><strong>I added a CSS hover style that will change the color of the unselected keys to #3a3f58 and the guessed letter keys to the same color #f7a964 so no color change will appear to be happening for the previously guessed letter keys.</strong> </p>

<p>Enjoy and have fun!!</p>
